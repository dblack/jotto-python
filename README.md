# Jotto in Python

Jotto is a word-guessing game. You try to guess the computer's secret five-letter word; it tries to guess yours. 

To play:

    ./play

When prompted, put in a guess of the computer's word (always five letters). The computer will respond with
how many letters you got right. NOTE: position does count. 

Then the computer will guess your word. Respond with the number of letters it got right. (Position counts!)

To test:

    cd jotto-python
    python -m unittest discover
